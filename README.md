The Smart-Inbox GitHub repository is dedicated to spam email detection and presents a comprehensive comparison of various machine learning models and techniques. The repository focuses on classifying emails into two categories: spam and not_spam. The goal is to provide an efficient and accurate solution for filtering unwanted email messages.
The repository includes implementations and evaluations of several machine learning models commonly used for spam detection. The models covered in the comparison are:

| Model               | Description                                                                                                     |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Naive Bayes         | A probabilistic classifier that applies Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.     |
| Logistic Regression | A linear classifier that uses the logistic function to estimate the probability of the target class.             |
| Support Vector Machines (SVM) | A binary classifier that separates data points by creating an optimal hyperplane.                       |
| Random Forest       | An ensemble classifier that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.                                |
| Gradient Boosting   | A boosting technique that sequentially builds weak learners to create a strong learner.                          |
| Neural Networks     | A deep learning approach that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes to learn complex patterns.    |
